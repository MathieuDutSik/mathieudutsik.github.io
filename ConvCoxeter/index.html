  <LI>
For a given Coxeter group W(S) acting on Rn, we can view it as a set of vector in Mn(R).
  </LI>

  <LI>
Then we can consider the facets of this polytope and their enumeration
  </LI>

  <LI>
This was considered in this <A href="http://nxzobi.people.wm.edu/birfi2.pdf">paper</A> where it was proved that for An and Bn there is only one orbit of facets given by the Birkhoff tensors.
  </LI>

  <LI>
For F4 it was claimed that there is only one orbit but this is <A href="F4_ListOrbit.pdf">false</A>
  </LI>


  <LI>
For H4 we found 1063 orbits of facets. See this <A href="H4_ListOrbit.pdf">document</A>
