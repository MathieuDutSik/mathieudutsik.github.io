<p>0_21 is a 4-dimensional polytope obtained by the convex hull of the 10 vectors

The facets of this polytope are in two classes
<UL>
<LI> 5 simplex facets
<LI> 5 octahedral facets
</UL>

The polytope 0_21+Pyr(octahedron) is obtained by replacing one of this octahedral facet by a pyramid over an octahedron. It is noteworthy that all other facets of this polytope are preserved and have the same number of incident vertices.
