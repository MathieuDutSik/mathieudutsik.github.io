</h3></center>


<UL>
  <LI>Geophysical models need in many cases to be coupled between themselves (wave to circulation, circulation to atmosphere, etc.)</LI>
  <LI>The great majority of geophysical are parallelized by the <b>MPI</b> parallel formalism, and in most cases the parallelization is done horizontally geographically</LI>
  <LI>A simple coupling strategy is to use the <b>MPI</b> command <b>MPI_COMM_SPLIT</b> in order to split the set of processors in two groups that hence exchange data</LI>
  <LI>The coupling is then done with each model sending data to the other and interpolating</LI>
  <LI>The Parallel Geophysical Model Coupling Library does such a coupling by using the following information:
  <UL>
    <LI>The node matrix that tells for each model for numerical node, to which CPU(s) they belong</LI>
    <LI>The sparse interpolation matrix between both models</LI>
  </UL>
and uses it in order to build the commands <b>MPI_INTERP_SEND</b> and <b>MPI_INTERP_RECV</b> from it. Those commands are almost optimal in terms of the size of data exchanged.</LI>
  <LI>There is also commands for computing the sparse interpolation matrix</LI>
  <LI>Code source is available from <A href="pgmcl.tar.gz">here</A>.</LI>
